                <h1>The Effects of Real-Time Scheduling on Containers</h3>
                <hr>
                
                <p>
                    I specifically take a look at Podman and Docker and how they are effected by a real-time system 
                    and scheduling. The following test were done on Linux 5.10.145 with the PREEMPT_RT patch (SCHED_RR).
                    Tests were done a simple single core device so CPU affinity was not tested in this case. The
                    following are samples of the tests,

                <p>Perhaps I will add GPIO interrupt tests later.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    There seems to be no real performance difference between docker and container-less during these tests. 
                    One thing to note is that since podman is daemon-less it does not have the issue that the docker engine
                    has where the swarm manager has to essentially schedule the worker nodes. Since podman uses conmon (where
                    conmon double-forks to daemonize and detach from the parent (podman) and launches its runtime as its child),
                    this means that the scheduling is done by the RT scheduler. Though more investigation is needed to determine 
                    how podman interacts with conmon.
                </p>

                    Docker is not completely fine, it has an extremely slow start up time and causes the image to boot up much 
                    slower than if docker was not included in the image. In addition, due to the way the swarm manager schedules 
                    its workers, I have a theory that the consistently high worst case latencies is caused by the RT scheduler
                    first scheduling the swarm manager and then the swarm manager instructs the worker node to perform a task.
                    My suspicion comes from decreasing the SCHED_RR time slices which significantly increases the worst case 
                    latencies (jumps all the way up to 2500us). This occurrence does not happen on podman.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One fear of the docker daemon is that there may exist a situation where priority inversion occurs 
                    which can cause performance issues. Of course, in this set up it is unlikely that such a situation 
                    exists especially since the image I built was very minimal. The priority of the daemon becomes much
                    more important when comparing it to root-less container engines such as podman since the performance
                    hit will be even greater if docker has to jump between user mode and kernel mode. 
                </p>
                <h3>Other Issues</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a lack of tools for real-time container management which means that some container engines
                        and their tools may not take into consideration the real-time requirements (e.g. docker swarm).</li>
                    <li>Shared caches, memory and I/O can reduce the real-time behavior. This may be an issue with Containers
                        as they would write to the shared cache more often and with a large amount of containers this may reduce the hit rate</li>
                </ol>
